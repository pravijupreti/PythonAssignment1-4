## Overview

This repository contains multiple assignments that are built and organized as separate modules. Users can choose the assignment they wish to execute by entering an integer corresponding to the assignment number. Each assignment has its own functionality:

- **Assignment 1**: String manipulation with a default value checker.
- **Assignment 2**: Grocery list management system (add/remove items).
- **Assignment 3**: Product retrieval (mock-up).
- **Assignment 4**: Sentence manipulation with specific operations.

The user is asked to choose the assignment they want to work with, and the corresponding program will run. The program includes error handling and input validation for a smooth user experience.

## Assignments
